## Project 1: Comparative Study of Countries

This project focuses on comparing various parameters of countries using Tableau. I analyzed data related to income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, and more. Using interactive visualizations and dashboards, I compared the performance of different countries and identified key insights related to their characteristics.

## Project 2: Comparison of Regions based on Sales

In this project, I used Tableau to compare sales between two regions. The goal was to analyze and visualize sales data, including total sales, average sales per order, number of customers, and more. By creating interactive visualizations and utilizing filters, I provided a comprehensive comparison of sales performance between the selected regions.
